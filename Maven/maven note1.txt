SDLC
---------

Planning

Requirement Anlysis
------------------------------
Software build phases
---------------------------------

Designing


Coding
------------------
properties files ,configruation files, resources
source code
compiling code
create documents



Testing
-----------
create resources
create test classes
compiling test cases
run test
generate reports

package 
------------
create a zip like file such as jar,war,ear for an application for distribution purpose

install
--------------
make this jar,war,ear available to local repository


deploying
-------------------------
make this jar,war,ear available to coprotate  repository ( for clients )

maintainance



Maven is  build tool which automates SDLC build phase.



For JDBC program , we require driver jar .
ie Application is depedent on dirver jar This is called as depedancy.

Maven can download depedent  dirver jar

Depedancy management is done by maven




Convention over configuration --> 
There is a project folder structure, naming convention, declarative model
 has to be followed by all developers to use and create maven project


unifrom build system
------------------------------------

Structure of Maven
----------------------------------
pom.xml = > Project  Object Model
--> Application info -> groupId ,artifactID , name , version
--> properties --> source and targate code version, other lib version 
--> dependencies --> these are downloaded on internet from maven cetral repository
--> Build info , Plugin config ,


Maven components -->

maven  --> phases , plugins ,goals

phases => it corresponses to sdlc life cycle phases , runs the phases by using plugin:goal

plugin => it is a piece of code in maven which runs phases with actions

goal => actions names or commands within a phase

Maven has three build life cycle 
---------------------------------
	clean  => cleans all compiled jars created  ie cleans the project

	default (build life cycle ) ==> used for compile,test..... 23 phases

	site = > to generate document

Each life cycle consist of multiple phases
-----------------------------------------------------


mvn compile  --->
mvn --> maven command
compile -- > compile phase of default life cycle which runs  compiler:compile where compiler is a plugin and :compile is a 
	action or goal

alternatively above command can be given
mvn compiler:compile








Maven has following repository --> plcace to store downloaded plugins,dependancies ...

Local Repository -- > plcace on a local machine
defaulst folder is->  C:\Users\Admin\.m2

Remote repository - > corporate repository place on the internet from where it is downloaded

Central Repository -> maven remote repository on the internet
