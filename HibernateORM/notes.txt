In JDBC , developer has to write query for a table,  wirte a 
program to take data from java object and set it to query ,
one by one with accurate mapping of java data to column,
and then execute query.


In java we can have One object consist of another object.
eg. Employee has Address.
In java , we are having association like one to one, one to many , many to many.
eg. One Student can opt for multiple Course, One Cource is opted my multiple Student.

In Java, we are having Inheritance,

In above situation, manual mapping in jdbc is tough.

Hibernate resolve all these problems.
Hibernate is a ORM ( Object Relational Mapping)  tool.
