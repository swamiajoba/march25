An Internet is a network of networks. It is a place where we can access any kind
of information.

While commnunication on network internet uses TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol /
Internet Protocol)  network protocol.

When Client ie browser sends request to the server and gets response from the server ,
it uses application protocol http (hyper text transfer protocol ) .

Request is called as http request.
Response is called as http response.

URL -> Unifrom Resource Locator
eg. https://www.amazon.in/

https => hyper text transfer protocol secure
(smtp=>simple mail transfer protocol , ftp=> file transfer protocol)

www => world wide web  => any public

amezon => domain name associated with IP address of the server

in => India

(.com => commertial  ,
 .net => networked 
 .us => for US ,
 .gov => government ,
 .edu => educational )

Sometimes url consist of web page name or web program name.

JEE server sits at Middle Tier.
JEE => Java Enterprise Edition

IT consist of 2 Containers.
1. Web Container -
==> Html , JavaScript , Servelts ,JSP , JavaBeans

2. EJB  ( Enterprise Java Bean ) container -
==>  Session Bean , Entity Beans and other EJBs....

When JEE server contains only web container then that server is called as WEB Server.
eg. Tomcat

When JEE server contains both containers then that server is called as AN APPLICATION Server.
eg. Web Logic , Oracle Apache, IBM Websphere , Glossfish


Folder Structure of an web application

MyWebProject (root folder )
	| .html  .jsp  .js images
	|---- WEB-INF
	|	| web.xml  == >  web application configuration file (deployment descriptor )
	|
	|- -- classes  -- > servlet classes, javabean classes	


Context - root is a url used by browser to access web application on the server.

Servlet Configuration
-> servlet name   --> DemoServlet
-> servlet class with package -- > com.controller.DemoServlet
-> url pattern  --> /DemoServlet.view




jakarta.servlet.GenericServlet --> implements  interface jakarta.servlet.Servlet
	|
	|
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet
`	|
	|
com.controller.DemoServlet

Class is said to be servlet , if it implments Servlet interface

GenericServlet can handle any protocol request ie http,ftp, smtp.
whereas
HttpServlet can handle only http protocol requests. for eg 
http methods   -- get,post ,put,delete,option...
for each http method HttpServlet has respective method to handle request
for eg. doGet , doPost ................


get method  -- > form data can be send via url and visible to url.  Lmited data can be send
default http method is get method


post method --> form data is sent via http request body , not as a url . Unlimited data can be send
