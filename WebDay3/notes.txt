JSP is having 5 types of syntax

1. Directive  -
 	There are three directives
	<%@page   %>  --> direction to web page
	<%@include   %> -- > includes another file
	<%@taglib   %>  --> refer custom tags library

2. Scriptlets
	<% LocalDate today=LocalDate.now();  %>

	In Scriptlets we wirte Java Program in jsp.

3. Expression
	<%=today %>

	Used for printing variable value	
	This is equivalent to <% out.println(today); %>
